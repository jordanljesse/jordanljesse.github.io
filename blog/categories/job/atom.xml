    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I received my fist rejection letter and to be honest it kind of feels like a right of passage. I can only imagine how many rejection letters developers who&rsquo;ve come before me have received. I applied to a paid internship at Launch Code in Kansas City and received a professional yet tactful &lsquo;no&rsquo; regarding the position, suggesting that I practice interviewing more and reapply in the future. Admittedly, I did <em>not</em> do much in the way of preparation for the HackerRank code puzzles and they wound up hitting me in some pretty weak areas(manipulating arrays, math functions, etc). However, because I failed those code puzzles I now have a better idea of where I need to spend more of my self-study time, which is good.</p>

<p>When I first received the notice that I was rejected I <em>did</em> feel bewildered, as if perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to be a professional developer. &ldquo;Maybe I just should just stick to design, making t-shirts and posters?&rdquo; I thought to myself. That kind of work can be fun. But, and it&rsquo;s a big <em>but</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy that part of my brain that loves a good logic puzzle(especially coupled with technology!). Failure is a hard thing sometimes, but I&rsquo;m realizing lately that as long as I&rsquo;m able to learn <em>something</em> from the experience it&rsquo;s not a waste. That, and I&rsquo;m getting the impression that a <em>lot</em> of professional developers spend a <em>lot</em> of time in a state of frustration. As a result, I feel the need to get my mind organized as positively as possible and to increase my mental resilience to difficult problems. It would seem that I need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>
