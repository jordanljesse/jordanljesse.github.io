I say polymath because I enjoy cultivating a variety of skills that are(mostly) complimentary to one another.

<p>I want to start this blog because I spend a fair amount of time solving beginner problems related to web development and would like to document them with the hope that other developers starting out might find something useful and save themselves some time.

With that said, welcome to my blog and feel free to share any questions/comments you might have. Cheers!</p>
