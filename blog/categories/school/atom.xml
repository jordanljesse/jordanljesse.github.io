    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning was rough; I felt like I wrote more bugs than functioning code. I’m trying to encrypt the user’s password before it is sent to the server and ran into some trouble with the <code>salt</code> portion of the encryption. Nevertheless, I’m getting more confident in my ability to debug things, knowing which tools to use, and how to follow the flow of data through my application from the user’s input on the front end to the database in the back end. By the late evening, I had my second component mostly complete and felt like I was able to learn from most of this morning’s missteps.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started working on my second component today and it was different from the first in that it already contained a bunch of code that I had to work around, which provided some extra challenges. The main thing I learned about today was encryption and how to apply it to a user’s password; trying to handle the password so that it’s secure is tricky business however I’m really enjoying the challenge.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I thought I finished my full stack component yesterday, however I added some validation to the API I wrote with C#… and it broke. As a result, today I learned how to troubleshoot The Unity framework configuration, how to implement validation on the server(as opposed to client side), and how to improve my debugging by digging into the call stack more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finished up my full stack component last night and spent today giving it some styling and then integrating it into the main project. I learned some fancy git commands like <code>git log --all --graph --pretty=oneline</code> and how do deal with merge conflicts(edit by hand with attention to detail). Reading and writing code is feeling more natural with each day. I finally installed the Vim plugin in Visual Studio so that I can start moving around my code more nimbly! I find myself marveling at how clever Vim is ever time I use it - my goal is to be a Vim wizard by the end of this year.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent most of today feeling overwhelmed and trying to keep my head up and press forward despite the feeling. We started building our individual components today, from the database, through the middle tier, and to the front end(using SQL, .NET, and AngularJS respectively). I struggled most of the day to understand how all of the pieces communicate with each other, however by the end of the day I felt like I had a grasp on the flow of data.<!--more--></p>

<p>I was able to write a console application that allowed me to test the API I had written in C# along with the SQL procedures. The pace is definitely moving fast at Sabio however I feel like I’m learning some non-trivial new things every single day here. I’m looking forward to going in tomorrow and building out the front end of this component with AngularJS, and then watching the data go from the client, to the Angular controller, to the Angular service, to the Api Controller, to the Api Service, to the SQL database, and back again. The internet is a series of pipes indeed!</p>
