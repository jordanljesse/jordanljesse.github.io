    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent alumni that just got hired at an extremely desireable company with offices in Santa Monica came by to talk with my class about his job hunting experience and to answer some our questions. The visit was inspiring and a little anxiety inducing at the stame time; the former because it was great to hear a (mostly)self-taught developer success story and the latter because it reminded me of how much there is out there I just don’t know yet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I struggled with my health today and as a result I wasn’t able to write as much code as I would have liked. I’m going to make this evening about self-care so that I can get back on top of my feature tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like my learning approach for the last few months has been breadth before depth and lately I’ve been wanting to take a few days to dive deeply into a few areas that I feel need bolstering, like currying and recursion.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Saturdays in Los Angeles are amazing. Farmer’s markets, no traffic, and almost always perfect weather. I spent most of the day designing a user selectable theme feature for the open source logging tool we’re building, along with a dark themed UI. I was glad to have an opportunity to dig into CSS animations after listing to <a href="http://rachelnabors.com">Rachel Nabors</a> on the <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-and-why-is-web-animation">Code Newbie</a> podcast(highly recommended).<!--more--></p>

<p>I was trying to survive traffic on the 405 when something Nabors said jumped out at me: <em>perceived</em> load time is more important than <em>actual</em> load time. I had never thought about how the user actually perceives the load time of something when I’m looking at benchmark metrics for a website; it turns out those metrics don’t tell the whole story. As a result, my plan is to incorporate some of Nabors ideas from the podcast into this open source note taking tool in the hopes that it will ease the cognitive load of the user and take some of the <em>friction</em> out of note taking.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was demo day for a couple cohorts that are ahead of us. I’m always amazed at the amount of features that each cohort is able to cram into their app in the short amount of time they have to work on it. It’s simultaneously inspiring and intimidating to see how high the bar is here at Sabio.</p>
