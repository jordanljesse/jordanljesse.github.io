    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I decided to dust off this Octopress blog that I had started back in the Spring of this year to find that my <code>rake</code> tasks weren’t running properly. After a brief search of the web it seemed that outdated versions of Ruby were to blame. However, I still needed to maintain these older versions of Ruby for other projects I’m working on. With that in mind, I set about learning how to manage multiple versions of Ruby on my Mac and stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/rbenv">rbenv</a>.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>First I’ll go over why I chose to use rbenv over similar tools like RVM and then get into how to install and use rbenv. The main reasons I choose to go with rbenv are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s <em>light</em> compared to RVM</li>
  <li>I can set <em>application-specific Ruby versions</em></li>
  <li><em>no configuration file!</em></li>
  <li>easier to get set up and back to work</li>
</ul>

<p>What rbenv does is essentially create a sandboxed Ruby environment for our project in which we get to control which version of Ruby is run, separately from the version that may be the default for our system. To start using rbenv we will want to have Homebrew installed and up to date. After making sure that Homebrew is up to date we are ready to install rbenv! You can see that rbenv also installs <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build">ruby-build</a>, a plugin that allows us to install multiple versions of Ruby and enables rbenv to specify which version to use for the current project.
<code>bash
$ brew update
$ brew install rbenv ruby-build
</code></p>

<p>When the above completes, we’re ready to install our desired version(s) of Ruby by running:
<code>
$ rbenv install 2.4.2
</code></p>

<p>We’ll also need to run the following command to install the shims required for all the Ruby executables that rbenv is aware of. We will want to run the <code>rehash</code> command each time we install a new version of Ruby or a gem that provides commands.
<code>
$ rbenv rehash
</code></p>

<p>After restarting our terminal we should be able to specify which version of Ruby we’d like to run in our project by <code>cd</code>-ing into the root folder of the project and running the following command:
<code>
$ rbenv local 2.4.2
</code></p>

<p>We can verify the current active Ruby version by running:
<code>
$ rbenv version
</code></p>

<p>And that’s it! We’re now able to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on a per-project basis with minimal fuss.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I’m teaching myself Ruby and today I decided to learn how to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a> sequence after hearing about them on Twitter. When I first looked at this particular problem, I had an idea of what was supposed to happen but was unsure of how to write the expression in Ruby - that is until I stopped to draw it out on paper.
<!-- more -->
Being a very visual person/learner, I found it helpful to write out the first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence with pen and paper, and then to sketch in where the variables would go and how they move as the sequence progresses. Once I was able to visualize how the variables leapfrog each other within the loop and are added together for the next number in the Fibonacci sequence, it was much more clear how I needed to write the expression in Ruby. Sometimes you just need to sketch something to see the pattern. By outlining my problem and subsequent solution with pen and paper first, I was able to spend less time writing code. My Fibonacci sequence in Ruby looks like this:
```ruby
# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, … Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 4 million.</p>

<p>class Fibonacci</p>

<pre><code>def initialize
    @numA = 1
    @numB = 0
    @fibonacci_number = 0
    @sum = 0
    self.fibonacci_sequence
end

def fibonacci_sequence
    while @fibonacci_number &lt; 4000000
        @fibonacci_number = @numA + @numB
        puts "fibonacci_number\'s current value is " + @fibonacci_number.to_s
        @numB = @numA
        @numA = @fibonacci_number
        @sum = @sum + @fibonacci_number
    end
    puts "The sum of the Fibonacci sequence thus far is " + @sum.to_s
end
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>fibonacciNumber = Fibonacci.new()
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made my first open source contribution today, and it felt triumphant! The challenges! The errors! The long nights searching the internet by candlelight!(Okay maybe not that last part.)<!--more--> Feeling like you’re contributing to something bigger than yourself.  To be clear, I only replaced an outdated link with a more current one, but that doesn’t mean that the first step of a long journey is less exciting.</p>

<p>Since deciding that I would learn how to code, I’ve always been enamored with open source software, or more specifically <em>free</em> open source software(there’s a difference – ask <a href="https://stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a>). So when I learned that Operation Code was a FOSS program designed by veterans to help fellow veterans I knew I had to be a part of it. I think that the majority of veterans miss being part of a team working towards a common goal; I know I do. Being able to spend time working on a project like Operation Code makes me feel like I’m able to give back, even if it’s in a small way.</p>
