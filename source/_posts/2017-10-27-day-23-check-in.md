Today we learned more about data structures, binary trees, and how to traverse a binary tree using recursion. I'd always perceived binary trees as some scary part of the interview process based off of the complaints of tech interviewees on social media, however they didn't seem that complex and traversal via recursion made really good sense.<!--more-->

Additionally, today I learned that if you want a little green square to show up on your GitHub commit graph that your name and email, specifically the email you login to GitHub with, need to be configured in git. Good to know!

### Binary Tree Traversal Via Recursion

##### Preorder
- node(contains contents, left child, and right child)
- traversal function uses recursion
- print the parents before the children

##### Postorder
- print the children before printing the parents

##### Inorder
- print the left child, print the parent, then print the right child
