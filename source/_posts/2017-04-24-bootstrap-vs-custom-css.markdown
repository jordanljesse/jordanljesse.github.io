So I've been following along with freeCodeCamp, which I switched to from The Odin Project, and one of the earlest things you learn through fCC is how to style HTML with Boostrap. In fact, I felt like the tutorial glossed over CSS in order to get to Boostrap quicker, which abstracts away a lot of what the CSS is actually *doing*. The first few websites I made, I've designed and then written the markup followed be the necessary CSS to get as close to the static design as possible. However, with this project, I've simply sketched out some wireframes in pen and proceeded to writing markup *and* styling it as I go with Bootstrap. I feel like I'm moving slow with this code, having to look up almost everything I want to do with Boostrap before I'm able to do it(with vanilla CSS I feel like I could just write wWhat I want to see - mostly). I wonder how much of my frustration is Boostrap abstracting away a lot of the CSS and how much of it is becasue I skipped big parts of the design process(lofi wireframes, hifi mockups)?
