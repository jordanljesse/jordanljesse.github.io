So I've been following along with freeCodeCamp(fCC) and one of the earliest things you learn through fCC is how to style HTML using the Bootstrap framework. In fact, I felt like the fCC curriculum glossed over CSS in order to get to Bootstrap quicker. However, I feel like knowing vanilla CSS is more practical than knowing Bootstrap, which abstracts away a lot of what the CSS is actually *doing*. This may be a personal preference though as I feel *strongly compelled* to understand the inner-workings of my projects.

The first few websites I made I had designed them first before moving on to implementing them in code, trying to get as close to the high fidelity mockup PSD as possible. This work flow felt smooth and yielded decent results. However, redesigning my personal portfolio while following along with the fCC curriculum it seems that the design takes place in the browser and relies heavily on Bootstrap knowledge. I gotta' be honest, at first this approach irked me and felt a little lazy. Skip the static mockups? Where do my markers and sketchbooks fit into this work flow? I had almost decided to write off the fCC method in favor of my own(because speed) when I realized that I would be robbing myself of a learning opportunity.

I've simply sketched out some wireframes in pen and proceeded to writing markup *and* styling it as I go with Bootstrap. I feel like I'm moving slow with this code, having to look up almost everything I want to do with Boostrap before I'm able to do it(with vanilla CSS I feel like I could just write wWhat I want to see - mostly). I wonder how much of my frustration is Boostrap abstracting away a lot of the CSS and how much of it is becasue I skipped big parts of the design process(lofi wireframes, hifi mockups)?
