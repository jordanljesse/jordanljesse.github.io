It's Friday! Woohoo! Sabio hosted a meet 'n greet lunch this afternoon for all of the cohorts to meet each other and it was great to hear everybody's stories and put faces with the names we've been hearing about. My class has spent the day learning Angular and getting ready to rewrite the app we wrote with jQuery.
