I had an idea for an app last night that I really want to build, so I'm using it as an excuse to run through making a full stack CRUD app again with Angular/.NET/SQL. It's a web app to help new social workers track the hours required for their licensure. After hearing a few social workers frustrated with the process of tracking their hours it seemed like an app that could store the hours and return some meaningful analysis to the user would be the way forward - certainly more convenient than an Excel spreadsheet.
