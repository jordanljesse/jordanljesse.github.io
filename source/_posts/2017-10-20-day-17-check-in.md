I started working on my second component today and it was different from the first in that it already contained a bunch of code that I had to work around, which provided some extra challenges. The main thing I learned about today was encryption and how to apply it to a user's password; trying to handle the password so that it's secure is tricky business however I enjoy the challenge.
