How do I _actually_ include Angle Sharp in a new Visual Studio project? There are lots of tutorials on how to use Angle Sharp, but very few on how one includes the library in their own project. Do I add the whole folder? How can I start using Angle Sharp?

- Install it via NuGet package manager
- use it
