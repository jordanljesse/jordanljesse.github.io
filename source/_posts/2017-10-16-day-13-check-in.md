Today we kicked off the class project that we'll be working on for the next eight weeks and it looks awesome. I don't want to give too much away yet, but it's looking like an awesome info logging tool built with developers in mind that will be open sourced as it nears completion. We spent the morning making sure that everybody was able to clone the project to a local repo and get everything up and running, along with a high level overview of the project and what we'll be building.
