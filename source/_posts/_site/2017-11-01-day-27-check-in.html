<p>Cleaning up the git branch for the markdown note editor I made yesterday so I can submit a pull request today. It looks like the next feature I’ve got to build involves importing and exporting notes as JSON and using GUID’s to keep track of notes that might contain duplicate id’s on the server.</p>
