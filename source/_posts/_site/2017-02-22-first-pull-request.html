<p>I made my first open source contribution today, and it felt triumphant! The challenges! The errors! The long nights searching the internet by candlelight!(Okay maybe not that last part.)<!--more--> Feeling like you’re contributing to something bigger than yourself.  To be clear, I only replaced an outdated link with a more current one, but that doesn’t mean that the first step of a long journey is less exciting.</p>

<p>Since deciding that I would learn how to code, I’ve always been enamored with open source software, or more specifically <em>free</em> open source software(there’s a difference – ask <a href="https://stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a>). So when I learned that Operation Code was a FOSS program designed by veterans to help fellow veterans I knew I had to be a part of it. I think that the majority of veterans miss being part of a team working towards a common goal; I know I do. Being able to spend time working on a project like Operation Code makes me feel like I’m able to give back, even if it’s in a small way.</p>
