<p>So I thought I finished my full stack component yesterday, however I added some validation to the API I wrote with C#â€¦ and it broke. As a result, today I learned how to troubleshoot The Unity framework configuration, how to implement validation on the server(as opposed to client side), and how to improve my debugging by digging into the call stack more.</p>
