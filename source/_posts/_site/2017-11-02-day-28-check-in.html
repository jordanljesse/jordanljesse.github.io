<p>We had a substitute instructor today, which turned out to be pretty cool because our sub specialized in a different stack(Node.js) than our own(.NET), so we got exposed to some new ways of doing things. I started <em>and</em> finished a component today that crawls the IndexdDB and exports all of the notes it contains as JSON and vice versa(import JSON as notes in IndexedDB).</p>
