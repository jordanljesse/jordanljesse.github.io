<p>The Sabio bootcamp schedule includes Saturdays, so after peeling myself out of bed this morning I braced myself for 90 minutes of traffic on the 405 only to find that there was hardly any traffic at all, and before I knew it I had made the journey from the valley to Culver City in less than 30 minutes; it was an LA miracle!<!--more--></p>

<p>My class has started learning Angular and we have begun replacing all of the jQuery we used to solve our assignments with AnglarJs and it’s been fun but challenging. I ran into an issue today where I couldn’t get Angular to parse even the simplest of code(something like ``) and suspect that I’m having some sort of issue with project dependancies, I just can’t figure it out. I”ve tried linking to a local file, loading Angular from a CDN, and double checking my file paths to make sure they’re accurate along with my code. I need to sleep on the problem and tackle ig with fresh eyes.</p>
