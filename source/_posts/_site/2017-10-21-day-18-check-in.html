<p>This morning was rough; I felt like I wrote more bugs than functioning code. I’m trying to encrypt the user’s password before it is sent to the server and ran into some trouble with the <code>salt</code> portion of the encryption. Nevertheless, I’m getting more confident in my ability to debug things, knowing which tools to use, and how to follow the flow of data through my application from the user’s input on the front end to the database in the back end. By the late evening, I had my second component mostly complete and felt like I was able to learn from most of this morning’s missteps.</p>
