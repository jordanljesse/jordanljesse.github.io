<p>Holy smokes. Today I <em>finally</em> completed my two full stack components, however I’ve said that at standup for the last week it seems, so my ability to predict when something will be “done” needs work. I’m excited to start working on my assigned feature for this techie logging tool, the user registration/login, mostly because with all the news lately(Equifax) I’d like to learn more about seurity and things to be aware of.</p>
