<p>Holy crap it rained in Los Angeles this morning! Somehow, rain in LA affects drivers like snow does in Kansas; strange. We got introduced to IndexedDB this morning which seems like a clever way of storing things locally in the user’s browser(instead of a database). This afternoon I <em>finally</em> finished up the markdown editor for notes I’ve been working on the last few days! I’m hoping to move on to a feature that utilizes <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> as I’ve got a personal project I think would really benefit from data visualization.</p>
