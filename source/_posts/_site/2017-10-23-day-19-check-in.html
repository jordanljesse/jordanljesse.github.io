<p>I spent most of my day ‘off’ yesterday building a web app that can get the user’s location data and return the local weather using the Weather Underground API and the <code>navigator.geolocation</code> API built into HTML5. I learned a lot about SSL, HTTPS, and ports 443/80 while attempting(the operative word here) to securely retrieve and transmit the user’s location. You can check out my little weather API experiment <a href="http://codepen.io/jljesse/pen/LzvoJq">here</a>. Additionally, I’m trying to be better about digging into the call stack when I’m debugging; it’s a really helpful tool.<!--more--></p>

<p>I learned a small amount about cryptography and how writing your own crypto can be dangerous. With that in mind, my goal is to implement the salting and hashing of the user’s password by stitching together instructor supplied crypto libraries with a minimum of my own code. Bonus round: today I learned that encryption != hashing.</p>
