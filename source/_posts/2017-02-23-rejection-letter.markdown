Today I received my fist rejection letter and to be honest it kind of feels like a right of passage. I can only imagine how many rejection letters developers who've come before me have received. I applied to a paid internship at Launch Code in Kansas City and received a professional yet tactful 'no' regarding the position, suggesting that I practice interviewing more and reapply in the future. Admittedly, I did *not* do much in the way of preparation for the HackerRank code puzzles and they wound up hitting me in some pretty weak areas(manipulating arrays, math functions, etc). However, because I failed those code puzzles I now have a better idea of where I need to spend more of my self-study time, which is good.

When I first received the notice that I was rejected I *did* feel bewildered, as if perhaps I wasn't smart enough to be a professional developer. "Maybe I just should just stick to design, making t-shirts and posters?" I thought to myself. That kind of work can be fun. But, and it's a big *but*, it doesn't satisfy that part of my brain that loves a good logic puzzle(especially coupled with technology!). Failure is a hard thing sometimes, but I'm realizing lately that as long as I'm able to learn *something* from the experience it's not a waste. That, and I'm getting the impression that a *lot* of professional developers spend a *lot* of time in a state of frustration. As a result, I feel the need to get my mind organized as positively as possible and to increase my mental resilience to difficult problems. It would seem that I need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.
