I finished up my full stack component last night and spent today giving it some styling and then integrating it into the main project. I learned some fancy git commands like `git log --all --graph --pretty=oneline` and how do deal with merge conflicts(edit by hand with attention to detail). Reading and writing code is feeling more natural with each day. I finally installed the Vim plugin in Visual Studio so that I can start moving around my code more nimbly! I find myself marveling at how clever Vim is ever time I use it - my goal is to be a Vim wizard by the end of this year.
