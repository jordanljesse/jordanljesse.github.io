I've been learning how to use TMUX and VIM lately, and I must say that it feels like taking the training wheels off of my computer. By that, I mean that it feels like a more complex way to use my computer, however it also feels more efficient and 'freeing', in a way.

I first heard about TMUX from a friendly hacker(thanks Tyler!) at a Linux User Group meetup here in town. He showed me what it looked like, told me a little about what it could do, and then encouraged me to go home and give TMUX a try. A few nights later, I installed TMUX and read a few online tutorials, and now my life in the Terminal will never be the same again. I can't believe how much more convenient having sessions that can be detaached/reattached to are! Why didn't I do this years ago?!(I feel like I've been experiencing that sentiment at an(alarmingly) increasing rate).

I decided to take a look at VIM after getting the feeling that at some point in the future I would eventually wind up there(it seems that most dev wind up in vim-land eventually), so why not learn it a little early? I'm excited by the idea of an editor that's cross-platform and readily available. Not only that, but the concept of a modal editor that has a sort of minimal language used to interact with code strikes me as brilliant. The first night I went through the vim tutuorial(vimtutor), I stayed up late lying in bed thinking about how much more efficient vim seems compared to a more modern editor(Sublime Text, Atom, etc.).
