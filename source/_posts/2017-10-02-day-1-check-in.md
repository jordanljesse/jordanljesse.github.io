Today was the first day of "code bootcamp" at Sabio and it was similar to the first day of class at most colleges - review the code of conduct, overview of the syllabus, and some warmup assignments to assess where each of us are skillwise. The instructor explains things in a way that never makes you feel small and the classroom feels open and airy with one glass wall.
