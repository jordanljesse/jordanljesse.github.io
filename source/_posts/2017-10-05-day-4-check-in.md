This morning we had our first standup meeting as we'll be working in an Agile/Scrum workflow for the duration of bootcamp. We learned about object references in JavaScript and the jQuery.data function. We received an introduction to Angular and it seems we'll be using that to build our apps moving forward. I'm excited to start digging into Angular tomorrow.

On a more personal note, I've been struggling to get my routines back online with the intense new schedule; 9am to at least 7pm Monday through Saturday. I haven't done my yoga, meditation, or workouts yet this week and it's starting to affect my productivity and focus. I think I need to prioritize my routines a little more if I'm going to maximize my experience here at Sabio.
