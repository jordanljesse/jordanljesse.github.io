Holy crap it rained in Los Angeles this morning! Somehow, rain in LA affects drivers like snow does in Kansas; strange. We got introduced to IndexedDB this morning which seems like a clever way of storing things locally in the user's browser(instead of a database).


Questions:
- describe async.
- what is the event queue?
- what is a promise?
