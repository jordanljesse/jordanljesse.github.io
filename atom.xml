    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you want to keep track of a group of objects in C#, you can do so by either creating arrays of objects or collections of objects. Collections offer a more flexible way of storing and referencing groups of objects compared to the fixed size and data type of arrays. The following is a brief overview of a few of the collections available in C# and their properties.<!--more--></p>

    <updated>2017-10-31T14:50:12-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/10/31/dirty-checking-vs-vdom</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What is the difference between updating the DOM using dirty checking and VDOM manipulation? Is one more efficient than the other? What the heck <em>is</em> the DOM? Let’s try to answer these questions!<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-dom">What is the DOM?</h3>
<p>To understand the differences between dirty checking and VDOM manipulation we first need to understand what the DOM is and isn’t.</p>

<h5 id="the-dom-is">The DOM is:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>a programming interface for HTML and XML documents</li>
  <li>an object-oriented representation of the HTML we wrote made up of nodes and objects</li>
  <li>automatically created from the HTML we wrote by the browser</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="the-dom-is-not">The DOM is not:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>the actual HTML we wrote</li>
  <li>the markup we see when we choose ‘view source’ on a page</li>
  <li>always the same as our HTML(browsers sometimes fix invalid markup behind the scenes)</li>
</ul>

<p>The DOM can be manipulated and edited using a scripting language like JavaScript including libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, and React. In fact, the DOM actually has its own API for interacting with other bits of code. Much of what is thought of as a “JavaScript thing” is actually a DOM API feature that allows us to interact with the DOM.</p>

<h3 id="dirty-checking">Dirty Checking</h3>
<p>Dirty checking is when our code loops through all of the node’s data at regular intervals for changes. It’s an inefficient way to update DOM elements as it requires recursively traversing every single node in the DOM to see if the node’s data is “dirty”(been changed). Compared to “Observable Checking”, where the individual components are responsible for listening to when changes take place in the state and communicating those changes, dirty checking is slow. A good example of this slowness would be updating a <code>li</code> in an unordered list: when dirty checking discovers the updated <code>li</code> it will actually re-render the entire unordered list; a very ineffecient operation.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-dom">The Virtual DOM</h3>
<p>The virtual DOM, or VDOM, is an abstraction of the DOM that is lightweight and can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all of the same nodes, objects, and properties as the real DOM except without the ability to write to the screen. It’s worth noting that a new VDOM is created after every re-render of the UI. When using React a snapshot is made of the VDOM before applying any updates and this snapshot is used to compare against an updated VDOM. By comparing and contrasting the VDOM snapshot with the updated VDOM React is able to update only those elements that have been changed. Unlike the dirty checking example previously mentioned, VDOM manipulation will only update the node that’s been changed <em>without</em> having to update its parent element or containing list. This is what makes VDOM manipulation faster and more efficient than dirty checking.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, then you probably store a lot of precious data on your digital devices: family photos, videos, music, fun projects, work projects, notes, and the like. When(it’s <em>definitely</em> when, not if) we experience a device failure/loss, the last thing we want to worry about is whether the data we’ve accumuated over the years, our digital life, is safe or not. Here is the backup strategy I use to make sure that when a computer fails it’s a minor inconvenience instead of a major headache(or heartache).
<!-- more --></p>

<h3 id="the-3-2-1-rule">The 3-2-1 Rule</h3>
<p>There is a rule for reliable digital backups called <a href="https://www.carbonite.com/en/cloud-backup/business/resources/carbonite-blog/what-is-3-2-1-backup/"><em>The 3-2-1 Rule</em></a> and it goes like this: for our data to be properly backed up it needs to exist in <em>three</em> places, on <em>two</em> seperate mediums, and with at least <em>one</em> backup offsite. So if we have a copy of our data on our laptop, an external hard drive, and in the cloud we can be pretty confident that our data is safe. Let’s dig into the tools to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="local-versioned-backups">Local Versioned Backups</h3>
<p>The first, and perhaps easiest to implement, backup we should make is a local versioned backup of our data. The <em>“local”</em> in local versioned backup means that the data exists locally, physically near us, and not offsite on some remote server or cloud service(Dropbox, iCloud, etc.). The <em>“versioned”</em> part means that our data is backed up incrementally and different versions of our data are maintained. A good use case for this would be if we have a project we’re working on and the files get corrupted, or we make a change that we’re not happy with and want to restore the project to an earlier version. With local versioned backups, we can do this!</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to maintain local versioned backups of our data on a Mac is to use Apple’s own <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/support/timemachine/">Time Machine</a> software, which is included with every Mac. We open up <code>System Preferences</code>, select <code>Time Machine</code>, check the box labeled <code>Back Up Automatically</code>, and click on <code>Select Disk</code> to choose which disk we would like to use with Time Machine. It’s important to note that the disk we choose should <em>NOT</em> be our Mac’s startup disk - it should be a seperate disk. This is so that if our Mac were to fail or get lost our local versioned backup would remain intact, keeping our data safe. It’s worth mentioning that Time Machine only backs up our <em>data</em>(photos, videos, music, notes, etc.), <em>not</em> our applications or settings, which is where our second backup comes in.</p>

<h3 id="local-bootable-backups">Local Bootable Backups</h3>
<p>A local bootable backup is like the previous backup, except with two major differences: it backs up our <em>entire</em> hard drive including data, apps, and settings, and we can use it to boot up our computer. The <em>“bootable”</em> in local bootable backup means that we can take the drive that contains our backup, plug it into another computer, and boot from it. It is a clone of our system in its entirety. One of the shortcomings of this type of backup is that if we make a change to a project that we don’t like or a file gets messed up, those changes will get backed up to the local bootable backup as well. That is exactly why we keep a versioned backup <em>in addition to</em> a bootable backup.</p>

<p>For a bootable backup I use and highly recommend the application <a href="https://bombich.com"><em>Carbon Copy Cloner</em></a> by Bombich Software. After installing Carbon Copy Cloner, we select which disk we would like the application to use as a backup(again, one that is <em>seperate</em> from our startup disk), the schedule for our backup(I recommend daily), and click on the <code>clone</code> button.</p>

<h3 id="offsite-backups">Offsite Backups</h3>
<p>An offsite backup of our data is data that is literally <em>offsite</em> - it is located far away from our devices and backup drives. This is typically used as a worst case scenario backup, like if our house were subject to flood, fire, or theft. It would be nice to know that if we were unfortunate enough to lose everything that all of our data would be safe somewhere, and with an offsite backup this is possible.</p>

<p>For most people, one of the easiest ways to maintain an offsite backup is to use a service who’s mission is to keep our data backed up safely. Services like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> can back up our entire computer to their servers(the cloud) and restore those files at our request.</p>

<p>For the more technically inclined, I use and recommend <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com">Arq</a> configured to back up our data to AWS Glacier servers, which have relatively low storage fees. Arq is essentially Time Machine for the cloud - it creates versioned backups of our data stored on a server of our choosing. As long as we have an internet connection our files are constantly being backed up to the cloud. However, unlike local backups, we will need to be connected to the internet to restore our files.</p>

    <link href="http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/09/18/managing-multiple-ruby-versions/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-18T23:20:20-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/09/18/managing-multiple-ruby-versions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I decided to dust off this Octopress blog that I had started back in the Spring of this year to find that my <code>rake</code> tasks weren’t running properly. After a brief search of the web it seemed that outdated versions of Ruby were to blame. However, I still needed to maintain these older versions of Ruby for other projects I’m working on. With that in mind, I set about learning how to manage multiple versions of Ruby on my Mac and stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/rbenv">rbenv</a>.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>First I’ll go over why I chose to use rbenv over similar tools like RVM and then get into how to install and use rbenv. The main reasons I choose to go with rbenv are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s <em>light</em> compared to RVM</li>
  <li>I can set <em>application-specific Ruby versions</em></li>
  <li><em>no configuration file!</em></li>
  <li>easier to get set up and back to work</li>
</ul>

<p>What rbenv does is essentially create a sandboxed Ruby environment for our project in which we get to control which version of Ruby is run, separately from the version that may be the default for our system. To start using rbenv we will want to have Homebrew installed and up to date. After making sure that Homebrew is up to date we are ready to install rbenv! You can see that rbenv also installs <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build">ruby-build</a>, a plugin that allows us to install multiple versions of Ruby and enables rbenv to specify which version to use for the current project.</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew update
</span><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install rbenv ruby-build
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>When the above completes, we’re ready to install our desired version(s) of Ruby by running:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv install 2.4.2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>We’ll also need to run the following command to install the shims required for all the Ruby executables that rbenv is aware of. We will want to run the <code>rehash</code> command each time we install a new version of Ruby or a gem that provides commands.</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv rehash
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>After restarting our terminal we should be able to specify which version of Ruby we’d like to run in our project by <code>cd</code>-ing into the root folder of the project and running the following command:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv <span class="nb">local </span>2.4.2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>We can verify the current active Ruby version by running:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv version
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>And that’s it! We’re now able to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on a per-project basis with minimal fuss.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Intro to Javascript Objects]]></title>
    <link href="http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/05/12/javascript-objects/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-12T10:10:43-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/05/12/javascript-objects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To understand how functions and other objects work in Javascript it’s important to first understand objects. What makes an object, how are they used, and what can we do with them? Let’s tackle a few of these questions!
<!-- more --></p>

<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
<p>Almost everything in Javascript is an object as the language is an object-based programming language(compared to an object-<em>oriented</em> language an object-<em>based</em> language lacks inheritance and subtyping). The first important takeaway is that an object is a collection of <em>properties</em> and that properties themselves are key/value pairs. When a property’s value is a function, that property is then referred to as a <em>method</em> and can be used by(or “called on”) the object that it is attached to. Additionally, while there are many predefined objects in the browser you can also create your own objects, complete with unique properties and methods. But how do we use these properties and methods?</p>

<h3 id="properties--methods">Properties &amp; Methods</h3>
<p>Objects and their properties/methods can be accessed by using <em>dot notation</em>. It’s also important to note that object names and property names are case-sensitive in Javascript.</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="nx">objectName</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">propertyName</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Additionally, properties can be accessed by the use of <em>bracket notation</em>, which yields the same results as the line of code above.</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="nx">objectName</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;propertyName&#39;</span><span class="p">];</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>In Javascript, any valid string can be used as a property name - even an empty string - however if a property name is not considered a valid identifier(such as a string that contains a space, hyphen, or begins with a number) it can only be accessed using bracket notation. Bracket notation is also useful for passing in dynamically generated property names and property names that are not determined until the program is run. Properties can also be referenced by using strings stored in variables:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">propertyName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;make&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nx">myCar</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">propertyName</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Chevy&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="nx">propertyName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;model&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nx">myCar</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">propertyName</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Impala&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>When it comes to methods, calling them is similar to calling properties, except that methods contain a pair of parentheses at the end for accepting arguments(much like a function because it <em>is</em> a function). It looks like this:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="nx">objectName</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">methodName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">argument</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>To pull it all together, here is what it looks like to create a new object with a method that accepts an argument and what happens when the method is called:</p>
<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="line"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dog</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nx">dog</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">speak</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ownerName</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Woof! Good morning&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">ownerName</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="nx">dog</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Dave&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// prints &quot;Woof! Good morning Dave!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h3>
<p>I highly recommend giving this <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html">excellent article</a> a read if you want a more thorough(and entertaining!) history of objects. Also, I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that I myself am still learning this stuff and while I do my best to pick up best practices and incorporate them into my thinking, this post will probably be revised as I better organize my understanding of objects. All that to say, read this with an open mind and a grain of salt ;-)</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Learning Bootstrap vs Vanilla CSS]]></title>
    <link href="http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/04/24/bootstrap-vs-custom-css/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-24T23:15:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/04/24/bootstrap-vs-custom-css</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know why I had an aversion to learning a framework. Perhaps I was a CSS purist? During my internet travels I had come to believe that frameworks were for people who didn’t understand the underlying “vanilla” language that powered them. I was wrong.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I’ve been following along with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/factorialize-a-number">freeCodeCamp(fCC)</a> and one of the earliest things you learn through fCC is how to style HTML using the Bootstrap framework. In fact, I felt like the fCC curriculum glossed over CSS in order to get to Bootstrap quicker. However, I feel like knowing vanilla CSS is more practical than knowing Bootstrap, which abstracts away a lot of what the CSS is actually <em>doing</em>. This may be a personal preference though as I feel <em>strongly compelled</em> to understand the inner-workings of my projects.</p>

<p>The first few websites I made I had designed them first before moving on to implementing them in code, trying to get as close to the high fidelity mockup as possible. This work flow felt smooth and yielded decent results. However, redesigning my personal portfolio while following along with the fCC curriculum it seems that the fCC workflow has me designing in the browser(skipping wireframes and mockups) and relies heavily on the Bootstrap framework. At first, this approach irked me and felt a little lazy. Skip the static mockups? Where do my markers and sketchbooks fit into this work flow? I had almost decided to write off the fCC method in favor of my own(because habits) when I realized that I would be robbing myself of a learning opportunity.</p>

<p>I decided that even if it added a whole day to my personal portfolio redesign that trying out new workflows and learning Bootstrap 4 would be worth the time. After all, it’s knowledge I can carry forward with me. I <em>did</em> decide to sketch out my site before coding it up though. Personally, I find it much easier to make design changes and get visual feedback using a design tool like <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> rather than designing in the browser or with an IDE. That said, after my first few hours googling various Bootstrap features the framework started to grow on me and I can now appreciate how knowing how to use it could speed up development on projects in the future. It definitely felt like a step forward after having used the <a href="https://960.gs">960 grid system</a> and I liked how easy it was to implement responsive features.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I’m teaching myself Ruby and today I decided to learn how to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a> sequence after hearing about them on Twitter. When I first looked at this particular problem, I had an idea of what was supposed to happen but was unsure of how to write the expression in Ruby - that is until I stopped to draw it out on paper.
<!-- more -->
Being a very visual person/learner, I found it helpful to write out the first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence with pen and paper, and then to sketch in where the variables would go and how they move as the sequence progresses. Once I was able to visualize how the variables leapfrog each other within the loop and are added together for the next number in the Fibonacci sequence, it was much more clear how I needed to write the expression in Ruby. Sometimes you just need to sketch something to see the pattern. By outlining my problem and subsequent solution with pen and paper first, I was able to spend less time writing code. My Fibonacci sequence in Ruby looks like this:</p>

    <id>http://jordanljesse.github.io/blog/2017/02/23/fail-forward</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I received my fist rejection letter and to be honest it kind of feels like a right of passage. I can only imagine how many rejection letters developers who’ve come before me have received. <!-- more -->I applied to a paid internship at a company in Kansas City and received a professional yet tactful ‘no’ regarding the position, suggesting that I practice interviewing more and reapply in the future. Admittedly, I did <em>not</em> do much in the way of preparation for the HackerRank code puzzles and they wound up hitting me in some pretty weak areas(manipulating arrays, math functions, etc). However, because I failed those code puzzles I now have a better idea of where I need to spend more of my self-study time, which is good.</p>

<p>When I first received the notice that I was rejected I <em>did</em> feel bewildered, as if perhaps I wasn’t smart enough to be a professional developer. “Maybe I just should just stick to design, making t-shirts and posters?” I thought to myself. That kind of work can be fun. But, and it’s a big <em>but</em>, it doesn’t satisfy that part of my brain that loves a good logic puzzle(especially coupled with technology!). Failure is a hard thing sometimes, but I’m realizing lately that as long as I’m able to learn <em>something</em> from the experience it’s not a waste. That, and I’m getting the impression that a <em>lot</em> of professional developers spend a <em>lot</em> of time in a state of frustration. As a result, I feel the need to get my mind organized as positively as possible and to increase my mental resilience to difficult problems. It would seem that I need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>

The long nights searching the internet by candlelight!(Okay maybe not that last part.)<!--more--> Feeling like you’re contributing to something bigger than yourself.  To be clear, I only replaced an outdated link with a more current one, but that doesn’t mean that the first step of a long journey is less exciting.</p>

<p>Since deciding that I would learn how to code, I’ve always been enamored with open source software, or more specifically <em>free</em> open source software(there’s a difference – ask <a href="https://stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a>). So when I learned that Operation Code was a FOSS program designed by veterans to help fellow veterans I knew I had to be a part of it. I think that the majority of veterans miss being part of a team working towards a common goal; I know I do. Being able to spend time working on a project like Operation Code makes me feel like I’m able to give back, even if it’s in a small way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! My name’s Jordan and I’m on a journey to learn how to code! This blog is a personal notebook of sorts to help me keep track of the things I’m learning and the tools I’m using. <!--more-->I’ve been coding as a hobby for a while now and recently I’ve decided to pursue becoming a professional developer. My goal is to get comfortable enough with the basics so that I can attend a coding bootcamp where I can find structure, comaraderie, and a mentor - and eventually get paid to learn!</p>

<p>So why start a blog? Why not? I spend a fair amount of time solving problems related to web development, developer tools, and computer maintenance and would like to document some of these endeavors with the hope that other developers might find something useful and save some time. Additionally, I want to be better about documenting my learning progress and projects so that in the future I can look back and see where I’ve been so that I can better appreciate where I am. With that said, welcome to my blog and feel free to share any questions/comments you might have. Cheers!</p>
