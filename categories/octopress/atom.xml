    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name’s Jordan and I’m a military veteran and polymath learning to code. I say polymath because I enjoy developing a variety of skills that are(mostly) complimentary to one another. I’ve been teaching myself how to code for a few months now, and recently I’ve realized that of all my creative pursuits(design, music, photography, painting) that writing code is the most satisfying and intellectually challenging. I want to start this blog because I spend a fair amount of time solving beginner problems related to web development and would like to document them with the hope that other developers starting out might find something useful. Additionally, I want to be better about documenting my learning path so that in the future I can look back and really <em>see</em> that I’ve made some progress. With that said, welcome to my blog and feel free to share any questions/comments you might have. Cheers!</p>
